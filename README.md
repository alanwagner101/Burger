# Burger

This app uses ExpressJS and Handlebars in conjunction with mySQL to create a faux burger joint experience 

The way it works is as such;
the user requests a burger, the burger is presented with the option to devour, and then upon devouring it is added to a list of all burgers devoured.
You can then decided to delete the list of devoured burgers and start over.

The challenge with this app was getting the ajax requests on the front end to cooperate with the REST methods on the back end. 
All in all it was fun building this app.

Hope you like it!
